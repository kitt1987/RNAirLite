#RNAirLite

RNAirLite is a react-native hot-update component just like CodePush, APPHub and pushy. The main differences between RNAirLite and the latter are:

* RNAirLite doesn't care about how to build a server-side patch repository. The only thing you need to do is upload all patches created by RNAirLite CLI to your WEB server or CDN just as regular static resources.
* RNAirLite can only update JS bundle and assets. If you linked component which contains Java or Obj-C codes in it, a new publish deserved.
